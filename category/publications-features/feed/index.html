										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bright Shitemi is the co-founder and Executive Director of Mental 360, a youth-driven and youth-focused organization that promotes mental health by raising awareness, creating support systems and advocacy for youth experiencing mental health challenges.</p>



<p>Mental 360 has been selected to join the Facebook Accelerator Programme in Kenya.</p>



<p><strong>What does it mean to be mentally healthy or mentally ill?</strong></p>



<p>Good mental health is when an individual’s mind is functioning correctly. It is the ability to cope with day to day stressors that affect our emotions, thoughts and feelings.</p>



<p>On the other hand, a mental disorder is an illness that affects a person’s mood, thinking and behaviour. Mental illnesses are often associated with distress and/or difficulty participating in social, work or family activities. It can be treated and managed with medicine, just like heart disease or malaria.</p>



<p><strong>What is the leading cause of mental health issues in the country?</strong></p>



<p>Mental health problems usually come as a result of many issues, but the one that stands out from our data is trauma from adverse experiences. I believe the youth face the highest risk, because most of them live in areas where there is a lot of stigma associated with mental illness.</p>



<p>Additionally, most young people lack the financial capacity to access quality mental healthcare.</p>



<p><strong>How did you end up here, bearing in mind that you studied economics?</strong></p>



<p>I got immersed in the field of mental health in 2016 after I lost some friends to suicide. Growing up, our definition of poor mental health was the naked man or woman on the streets. My friends never walked naked in public, but some of them lived and struggled with mental illnesses to the point where they took their lives.</p>



<p>That was a rude awakening for me. I became aware of the importance of mental health and learnt as much as I could so that I could save lives.</p>



<p>I had also been through some tough times myself and that put me in a good position to see the existing gaps in information on mental health. To address all this, I came up with Mental 360.</p>



<p><strong>What services does Mental 360 offer?</strong></p>



<p>We raise awareness, engage in advocacy and provide holistic and affordable therapy solutions. We use art, story-telling and experiential learning as tools for education and awareness creation.</p>



<p>We do in-talk therapy, art therapy and physical wellness. We also run a 24/7 helpline (0776543099) and reach out to the public on social media platforms. Additionally, we take our campaigns and programmes to schools, communities and work places.</p>



<p><strong>What have you achieved so far?</strong></p>



<p>Over the years, our awareness and therapy programmes have helped thousands of youth heal from trauma, while others have been transformed into mental health advocates. We have also designed and piloted Free Up mental health clubs which will be set up in learning institutions.</p>



<p>We have also been holding monthly support group meetings where people can share their experiences and learn from each other. Our flagship awareness and advocacy platform, The Cradle Arts Festival, was a huge success and we are doing it online this year.</p>



<p>Our work has been recognised as being among the impactful social enterprises in Africa, and we were recently roped into the Facebook Accelerator programme.</p>



<p><strong>What does this programme mean for you and the organisation?</strong></p>



<p>First, it is an indication that people are beginning to appreciate the benefits and importance of good mental health. It is also gives me an opportunity to network, learn, grow and scale our products and services.</p>



<p><strong>Apart from advocating for good mental health, what else do you do?</strong></p>



<p>I manage, mentor and support a generation of talented conscious artists through the Cradle Arts Festival. There is a great pool of budding talent in Kenya that can be used to unite the country and make the world a better place.</p>



<p><strong>Where do you want Mental 360 to be in the next few years?</strong></p>



<p>We want to take this campaign and break it down to the various contexts of our tribes. We want this issue to be owned by the community and for our interventions to be available to all.</p>



<p>We want the corporate world to embrace our initiatives. We want suicide rates to go down, we want suicide to be decriminalised as this will reduce stigma, improve reporting and help us plan effectively.</p>



<p>Someone who attempts suicide needs to be loved and put in hospital, not in jail. We want our programmes to not only heal but empower others socially and economically so that they can afford medication and therapy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bright Shitemi, 28 is a father, co-founder of the Mental 360 organisation, a communications professional and a social worker, who is determined to change the mental health narrative in Kenya. He speaks to Maria Nene about it</p>



<p>Briefly tell us about yourself</p>



<p>I’m a social person who loves working with people and impacting their lives.</p>



<p>You’ve decided to address a thorny issue not only in the Kenyan society but also in the African cultural setting, what inspired you to do it?</p>



<p>I lost some close friends to suicide over a stretch of five years. I was always bothered about why someone with a promising future would end their lives. I sought to find out why and I learned mental illness was to blame. This led me to research on this issue. Looking around me, I noticed the problem was actually bigger and minimal effort was being put towards awareness and treatment. I identified stigma as the main problem leading to suicide and I started to come up with ideas to improve the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Share the journey towards forming Mental 360</p>



<p>I met some friends, Nafula Kisiangani, who is a social justice advocate and David Waheire and I shared my idea with them. They were inspired to help and we set up this organisation. With limited resources, we have been able to make major progress and we have had a lot of impact. We have had talks in high schools, partnered with PAWA&nbsp;and been able to bring on board volunteer psychologists for first-line interventions. Within three months, 15 young people&nbsp;have come out about their mental health struggles and they have gotten help. These are individuals who were suffering in silence and couldn’t afford professional help or were in fear due to lack of a safe space where they could express themselves freely.</p>



<p>How has Mental 360 been received by the society?</p>



<p>The response has been overwhelming. Through our programmes, we have educated about 600 students about mental illness and health and shared intervention channels with them. Our organisation is one of them. Like I said earlier, 15 people approached us and we were able to integrate them in our group sessions and to take them through therapy.</p>



<p>In your opinion why are we so afraid of addressing mental health issues?</p>



<p>Lack of awareness and information has caused our society to clamp down on mental health. When people find out that anyone has a mental health issue, they tend to think that you are insane or mad and you can’t handle any of your issues. As a result, people are scared of coming out because they fear being segregated.</p>



<p>What can be done to banish these thoughts?</p>



<p>Awareness and advocacy should be key features of accepting and addressing mental health. If people are aware those mental conditions exist and they can be managed appropriately then it will be excellent. If the people in our society who have mental health issues are open and they talk about the different mental conditions they have and how they have learned to co-exist with them, then it will be a good move. Various stakeholders should also come on board and support mental health organisations and provide a means for those people who are suffering to address their issues satisfactorily.</p>



<p>You recently had a talk about people in the creative industry and mental health issues, why do you think this industry is susceptible to it?</p>



<p>The creative industry is faced with a myriad challenges that may lead to mental health issues. The common illnesses people in this industry may be vulnerable to include depression, anxiety, and substance abuse. Susceptibility is a complex issue but, in my opinion, it is due to the extreme pressure people in the creative industry face when trying to eke&nbsp;out a living from their careers. This coupled with the burden of expectation brought about by show business and reality may lead to mental health issues.</p>



<p>Where does Kenya lie globally in tackling mental health issues?</p>



<p>Kenya is a fast developing and highly sophisticated economy with a bulging population. However, it allocates inadequate resources to mental health facilities this leads to a low ratio of mental health officials and patients. This has led to a lack of awareness for mental health and a steep rise in suicide rates. Very few public hospitals have functioning psychiatric wards. At Mental 360 we are petitioning the Government to allocate more resources towards mental health. Secondly, our laws are structured in a way that attempted suicide is criminalised. Such people need help and not jail. Jail makes them even more frustrated and worsens the condition.</p>



<p>There has been an upsurge in suicides in the country especially for males, why do you think this has happened? How can it be addressed?</p>



<p>African society does not accept that a man is also an emotional being. Therefore, men are expected to be brave in the face of every life episode and turn out fine. This stifles many of them emotionally and they end up going down the road of self-ruin. Women are also genetically predisposed to be emotionally stronger so that may be the reason why they don’t resort to suicide as a means of solving their issues. We need to tell people that it is OK to be weak&nbsp;and reach out for help regardless of your gender. It is a sign of strength to seek help. This is why the country needs awareness on mental illness and health.</p>



<p>Which are the most common mental illnesses in the country?</p>



<p>Depression is one of the leading mental illnesses in the country; others are bipolar disorder, anxiety, and substance abuse.</p>



<p>Apart from addressing mental health issues what else do you do?</p>



<p>I run a&nbsp;PR and Communications firm. I’m also passionate about conservation and I volunteer for The Kakamega Forest Heritage Foundation.</p>



<p>When you were young did you picture yourself in the mental health field?</p>



<p>I’ve always loved helping people in society and addressing pressing issues that affect the population. Although I studied for a Bachelors in Business/Economics, I always knew I wanted to do humanitarian and social work.</p>



<p>You were once termed as a female magnet on campus, so is there a significant other?</p>



<p>I was an entertainment director in campus and this job entailed being social and not necessarily dating many women. No, I’m not dating anyone at the moment.</p>



<p>How would you advise someone struggling with mental health issues in a conservative country like Kenya?</p>



<p>I would advise the person to talk about any issue that they are struggling with to someone they trust. They should then consult a psychologist or a psychiatrist. Mental 360 can also assist this individual. We can be reached through our hotline number 0776-543099 or Facebook (Mental 360). We cater to those young people who don’t have a safe space or someone to talk to. Ultimately our vision is to kill the stigma attached to mental illness and reduce suicide, especially among young people.</p><p>The post <a href="https://mental360.or.ke/bright-shitemi-on-losing-his-dear-ones-to-mental-illness-and-his-hunger-to-create-awareness-around-the-same/">Bright Shitemi on losing his dear ones to mental illness and his hunger to create awareness around the same</a> first appeared on <a href="https://mental360.or.ke">Mental 360</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A recent World Health Organization (WHO)&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afro.who.int/news/covid-19-halting-crucial-mental-health-services-africa-who-survey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">survey</a>&nbsp;shows that the&nbsp;<strong>demand for mental health services is increasing in the African continent</strong>&nbsp;amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “<em>Covid-19 is adding to a long-simmering mental health care crisis in Africa. Leaders must urgently invest in life-saving mental health care services</em>“, said Dr&nbsp;<strong>Matshidiso Moeti</strong>, WHO Regional Director for Africa.</p>



<p><strong>Health is still a deficiently funded field&nbsp;</strong>of social services in most African countries and, compared with other areas of health, mental health services are poorly developed. Indeed,&nbsp;<strong>mental health issues</strong>&nbsp;often come&nbsp;<strong>last on the list of priorities for policy makers</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>receive very little attention from governments</strong>, resulting in a lack of mental health policies, programs or action plans.</p>



<p>The<strong>&nbsp;limited access to professional mental health care</strong>, in addition to certain cultural beliefs, results in a&nbsp;<strong>frequent recourse to care by spiritual and traditional medicine practitioners</strong>, some of whom employ abusive and coercive practices such as&nbsp;<a href="https://oneglobalvoice.it/interviste/vivere-in-catene-gli-abusi-sulle-persone-con-disturbi-mentali/?fbclid=IwAR01daKdI1x0bnI-INffT_MI2BwCM-TzTy4r0bC4ajEH4Hn6aXXtcouHDlk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chaining</a>&nbsp;patients, physical abuse and food deprivation.</p>



<p>To achieve the goal of mental health care for all Africans, many mental health organizations have been born over recent years with the aim of helping reduce suicide rate, promote a healthy lifestyle and abate stigma around mental illness.</p>



<p>In Kenya, we have discovered<strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://mental360.or.ke/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mental 360</em></a></strong>, a non-profit mental health organization seeking to promote mental health by raising awareness<em>&nbsp;through awareness campaigns, counselling, art therapy, yoga, social media engagement and events</em>, creating support systems and assisting youth experiencing mental health challenges.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/evewoman/article/2001293184/bright-shitemi-on-losing-his-dear-ones-to-mental-illness-and-his-hunger-to-create-awareness-around-the-same" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Bright Shitemi</strong></a>, social worker determined to change the mental health narrative in Kenya and co-founder of <em>Mental 360</em>, explained us the inspiration behind the foundation of the organization and which are the objectives, the obstacles, the results achieved to date and the future goals.</p>

<p><strong>What is Mental 360?</strong></p>



<p>Mental 360 is a&nbsp;<strong>youth-led non profit social enterprise</strong>&nbsp;that raises awareness on mental health and provides affordable and holistic mental health solutions.</p>



<p><strong>What was the inspiration behind its foundation? Where does the need to create such an NGO come from?</strong></p>



<p>I was inspired by the challenges I went through in search of safe spaces and support in a time of need.</p>



<p>There is a&nbsp;<strong>huge information and mental heath care gap in Kenya</strong>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong>little investment by the Government</strong>. More than that is the&nbsp;<strong>high level of stigma and cost of treatment</strong>&nbsp;thereby creating a need for innovative solutions.</p>



<p><strong>Could you please tell us the main objectives and core values?</strong></p>



<p>Our main&nbsp;<strong>objectives</strong>&nbsp;are:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Foster peer support</li>



<li>Increase access to mental health care</li>



<li>Reduce the stigma on mental illness.</li>
</ul>



<p>Our core&nbsp;<strong>values</strong>&nbsp;include:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Dynamic Brotherhood-Sisterhood</li>



<li>Non-discrimination</li>



<li>Integrity</li>



<li>Service to others.</li>

<p><strong>What is the team composition? What are the main attributes of the team members?</strong></p>



<p>The team is comprised of psychologists, program development experts, artists, physical wellness trainers and volunteer mental health advocates. The team members are youthful, passionate and professional.</p>



<p><strong>Which kind of activities take place? Why are they specifically geared for young people?</strong></p>



<p>Our activities revolve around&nbsp;<strong>awareness events using the arts, storytelling and experiential learning, physical wellness</strong>&nbsp;in yoga and dance, support groups and therapy offered on a sliding scale.</p>



<p>We view young people as the most vulnerable to mental health challenges due to the&nbsp;<strong>high exposure to socio-economic inequalities</strong>. Moreover when it comes to a highly stigmatized issue, investment on young people has higher returns apart from the fact that young people are the future. It is easier to secure the future than salvage the past.</p>

<p><strong>Which common challenges are young people facing in Kenya?</strong></p>



<p>Most common&nbsp;<strong>challenges</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>addiction, depression, anxiety&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;trauma arising from violence</strong>&nbsp;all compounded by&nbsp;<strong>lack of financial resources</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>underemployment</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Do you know the suicide rates in young people in Kenya and why they’re increasing? Has Mental 360 helped reduce them?</strong></p>



<p>It is estimated that we have at least&nbsp;<strong>311 suicides per year</strong>. For every successful suicide there are approximately 20 attempts. All this in an environment where&nbsp;<strong>suicide is glaringly under-reported</strong>&nbsp;due to the stigma associated with it and poor data collection systems in the health care sector.</p>



<p>We have been able to offer psychological first aid via our helpline 0770360360 where 60% of those reaching out have had suicide or suicide ideation and 5000 physical therapy sessions.</p>



<p><strong>How do art and creativity help prevent mental illness and emotional trauma?</strong></p>



<p>Art is a form of healing for the artist and for the user. It is a huge coping mechanism for those experiencing mental health challenges by providing emotional healing. Studies have shown that art helps people dealing with depression and anxiety by promoting well-being and creating a space for social connection.</p>



<p><strong>Are there other NGOs with the same mission in Kenya or other African countries?</strong></p>



<p>Yes.</p>



<p><strong>Which are the main obstacles in running your activities?</strong></p>



<p>The main&nbsp;<strong>obstacles</strong>&nbsp;are&nbsp;<strong>financial resources, social stigma and the law</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>In a campaign for awareness that is centered not just on the beneficiaries but the wider society, mental health work does need a lot of resources</strong>. For solutions to be sustainable they need to be holistic i.e you can not raise awareness and fail to provide affordable and accessible care. And you can not provide care to people that are not aware, sending beneficiaries back to a society that stigmatizes them.</p>



<p><strong>Social</strong>&nbsp;<strong>stigma is a big hindrance that discourages many from reaching out for support</strong>&nbsp;and many others from accessing care. We have seen cases of parents of minors or people in relationships with a power imbalance being prevented from support by those in control.</p>



<p><strong>The law does not recognise mental illness</strong>&nbsp;to the extent that can be seen to be progressive. Suicide is a crime in Kenya while for many it is a symptom of challenges within. Putting someone in jail only exacerbates the situation. There are no legal requirements for investment in mental health leading to a minute percentage of the budget being directed towards mental health institutions.</p>

<p><strong>What do you think has been your biggest accomplishment(s) so far?</strong></p>



<p>Our biggest accomplishment is in the daily effort we have made in offering psycho-social support.&nbsp;<strong>Each person that reaches us and is able to be transformed counts as the biggest reward</strong>&nbsp;for the work we do.</p>



<p><strong>What are your future goals?</strong></p>



<p>Our future goal is to&nbsp;<strong>mainstream the mental health conversation</strong>&nbsp;by making resources attractive, affordable and accessible to every Kenyan. We are already going towards achieving this after developing a digital app/web-based platform called&nbsp;<strong><em>Boma</em></strong>&nbsp;via the Facebook Accelerator Program 2020. The vision is to make this tool reach the whole continent providing solutions at the touch of a button.</p><p>The post <a href="https://mental360.or.ke/mental-360-in-kenya-against-youth-depression-and-suicides/">“Mental 360”, in Kenya against youth depression and suicides</a> first appeared on <a href="https://mental360.or.ke">Mental 360</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>
